## 1.1.1

* Use `var` in a small amount of newer code that used `let`, to match ES5 legacy support status of the rest of the module. We should probably decide on a strategy for moving this module to ES6, but there is no urgency.

## 1.1.0

* Addition of `wordsPerString`, `separator` and `format` options. Thanks to Matteo Veraldi.

## 1.0.0

* Addition of `maxLength` option, thanks to Scoombe.
